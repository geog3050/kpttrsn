## Repository Purpose:
The purpose of this repository is to act as a compilation of the quizzes and projects I completed as a part of GEOG 5055 - Geospatial Programming. 

## Personal Background:
In the spring of 2024, I will be completing my master's degree in environmental engineering from the University of Iowa. Most of my academic work is centered on water quality and flow, with my initial career experience comprising stormwater pollution permit compliance and hydrologic modeling.

My hobbies include playing Dungeons and Dragons with my friends, watching the Chicago Cubs, Chicago Bears, and Iowa Hawkeyes, and playing guitar. After the semester ends I'll be moving to Boston with my long-term girlfriend and our cat, Callie to start my career in Environmental Engineering Consulting.
